# VITYARTHI-PROJECT
A Python game built with Pygame where players control a bird to fly through moving pipes, avoiding collisions and scoring points by passing obstacles. Simple, fun, and educational.

Features
Animated bird sprites for realistic flapping motion.

Randomly generated pipe obstacles for endless gameplay.

Gravity and jump physics using the spacebar for bird movement.

Score tracking with high score display.

Game over screen with a functional restart button.

Graphics loaded from local image files.


How to Play
Start Game: Run the script to launch the game window.

Control: Press the Spacebar to make the bird jump.

Objective: Avoid hitting pipes and the ground. Each time the bird passes through a pair of pipes, your score increases.

Restart: If your bird collides with a pipe or the ground, click the green Restart button to play again.


Code Structure
Initialization of the game environment and window.

Game loop with event handling for keyboard and mouse inputs.

Functions for drawing floor, pipes, score, and restart button.

Collision detection and game state management.

Score updating and display.


Motivation
Creating this Flappy Bird game serves multiple educational and personal growth purposes:

Enhances problem-solving skills through game mechanics design.

Applies math and physics concepts such as gravity and collisions.

Boosts creativity with animations and game design.

Provides hands-on programming experience in Python.

Offers a fun and engaging way to learn game development.


Data Description
This project uses image assets to create game visuals:

img_45.png: Game Over screen image.

img_46.png: Background image.

img_47.png, img_48.png, img_49.png: Bird sprites for different wing positions.

img_50.png: Floor/base of the game.

greenpipe.png: Pipe obstacle images.

All images should be placed in the same directory as the script. These are standard PNG image files loaded using Pygame's image loader.


How to Use
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

Install Pygame via pip:

text
pip install pygame
Place all required image files in the script’s directory.

Run the Python script to start the game.

Control the bird using the spacebar to flap.

Avoid pipes and the ground to score points.

Click the green restart button to play again after game over.
